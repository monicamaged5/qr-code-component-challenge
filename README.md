## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
Built a QR Code component using HTML and CSS, learning how to center content with Flexbox.
Improved my UI styling skills with spacing, alignment, and responsive layout.

```css
body{
    background-color:hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    margin:0;
}

.container{
    background-color: white;
    max-width: 250px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    text-align: center;
    justify-content: center;
    padding: 12px;
    border-radius: 16px;
    margin: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
